	<h1><strong>World Population Prospects (1950-2100)</strong></h1>
	<p></p>
	<p>My dataset is part of a dataset created by the population division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. 'Part of' because I decided to scale it down to make it more manageable for the course, which introduces issues of subjectivity and uncertainty, though I have tried to be geographically fair!</p>
	<p>The dataset is interesting in many ways; Comparing how populations have changed over the last 65 years to what they're predicted to over the next 85; the differences between population patterns in countries around the world. It is always interesting to see what further 'truth' a dataset can reveal, and how you can best communicate that truth</p>
	<p>As someone new to coding I've encountered a few tricky moments so thanks to everyone on the forum who's helped me out!</p>
	<p>Looking forward to next week</p>

			var svg = d3.select("body")

						.attr("width", 700)

			d3.csv("worldpopulationbycountry.csv", function(data) {

				data.sort(function(a, b) {
					return d3.descending(+a["1950"], +b["1950"]);

					//If your numeric values aren't sorting properly,
					//try commenting out the line above, and instead using:
					//
					//return d3.descending(+a.lifeSatisfaction, +b.lifeSatisfaction);
					//
					//Data coming in from the CSV is saved as strings (text),
					//so the + signs here force JavaScript to treat those
					//strings instead as numeric values, thereby fixing the
					//sort order (hopefully!).
				});

				var rects = svg.selectAll("rect")
								.data(data)
								.enter()
								.append("rect");

				rects.attr("x", 0)

						return d["1950"] / 1000;

					.text(function(d) {
